    <p>
      Whose woods these are I think I know.   <br>
      His house is in the village though;   <br>
      He will not see me stopping here   <br>
      To watch his woods fill up with snow.   <br>
      My little horse must think it queer   <br>
      To stop without a farmhouse near   <br>
      Between the woods and frozen lake   <br>
      The darkest evening of the year.   <br>
      He gives his harness bells a shake   <br>
      To ask if there is some mistake.   <br>
      The only other soundâ€™s the sweep   <br>
      Of easy wind and downy flake.   <br>
      The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   <br>
      But I have promises to keep,   <br>
      And miles to go before I sleep,   <br>
      And miles to go before I sleep.<br>
    </p>
